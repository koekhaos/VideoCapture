# VideoCapture
A small HTA app I created to capture slices of live video streams via the VLC client at a job I had.
<p>
  The program works by connecting to a video stream source IP and port. Then it will automatically start recording at the set time and stop recording at the set time in specific timed increments. For example it could start recording at 3pm and stop recording at 5pm and record in 15 minute slices. It can also delete old files past a certain number of days automatically. It appears to still run fine in windows 11, but I cannot warranty it so use at your own risk.
